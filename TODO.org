** TODO add basic documentation                                        :doc:
why
how to use
how to build
how to run test
** TODO out-of-source builds                                         :build:
prob cmake
** TODO build dependencies                                           :build:
prob cmake
** TODO automated test                                                :test:
rather than eyeballing the output
** TODO add special interfaces for c++ programs                    :feature:
like failpoint lambdas
** TODO support shared libs                                        :feature:
this currently does not collect failpoints in shared objects, would
have to do some dlopen stuff
** TODO support a mini-language for enabling failpoints            :feature:
 e.g. have failpoints be enabled 10% of the time, or off for 5 times
 then on, etc.  would need to balance this with the failpoint
 overhead, since ideally we want these in production builds and not
 having to do separate failpoint/debug enabled builds.
