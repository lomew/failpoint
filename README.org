* About

A way to enable and disable code throughout a program without having
to do too much.  Useful for fault-injection testing.

Works on Linux, and maybe other platforms that use ELF binaries.

Under construction.

* Todo
- doc: add basic documentation
- build: out-of-source builds, prob cmake
- build: dependencies, prob cmake
- test: automated test
- feature: add special interfaces for c++ programs, failpoint lambdas
- feature: support shared libs.  this currently does not collect
  failpoints in shared objects, would have to do some dlopen stuff
- feature: support a mini-language to have failpoints be enabled 10%
  of the time, or off for 5 times then on, etc.  would need to balance
  this with the failpoint overhead, since ideally we want these in
  production builds and not having to do separate failpoint/debug
  enabled builds.
